# I made a Blog

Weird isn't it; it seems kina low on the priority list. But it has a purpose: document all the things

## Maths testing

This is still in progress; and below is one such test; Maths

Lift($L$) can be determined by Lift Coefficient ($C_L$) like the following
equation.

$$ L = \frac{1}{2} \rho v^2 S C_L $$

Integrated maths utilities are helpful for explaining mathsy things; but so are integrated diagrams useful too:

## Mermaid Testing

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Alice
    participant Bob
    Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?
    loop Healthcheck
        John->>John: Fight against hypochondria
    end
    Note right of John: Rational thoughts <br/>prevail!
    John-->>Alice: Great!
    John->>Bob: How about you?
    Bob-->>John: Jolly good!
```

If the blog is working correctly you should see a rendered [mermaid.js](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/) diagram rendered. This is work in progress because pre-rendering them is kinda broken due to poorly designed software stacks

### Another graph

This is a test of inline graph styling, which currently doesn't work:

```mermaid
%%{init: {'theme': 'base', 'themeVariables': { 'primaryColor': '#ffcccc', 'edgeLabelBackground':'#ffffee', 'tertiaryColor': '#fff0f0'}}}%%
        graph TD
          A[Christmas] -->|Get money| B(Go shopping)
          B --> C{Let me think}
          B --> G[/Another/]
          C ==>|One| D[Laptop]
          C -->|Two| E[iPhone]
          C -->|Three| F[fa:fa-car Car]
          subgraph section
            C
            D
            E
            F
            G
          end
```

See [here](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/theming) for how it should look

## GFM + Github testing

~~This doesn't work yet :/~~

It works now; Issue was versioning :/

| foo | bar |
| --- | --- |
| baz | bim |
| baz | bim |
| baz | bim |

Github style syntax now also works: #10
