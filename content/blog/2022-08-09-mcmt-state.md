# What's up with MCMT

So basicly, a lot, and not a lot. <!--more--> The main issue with maintaining MCMT is the the grind of dealing with increasingly either esoteric or futile issues, which either went nowhere fast, or seemed sufficiently automatable that solving them all by hand was not really my thing

## Issues

So basicly, stuff went wrong and my brain said no, but here's what I think is a rough summary grouped into vague categories.

### Tooling issues

Writing java bytecode by hand is a pain and writing java bytecode transformers is worse. Doing this in javascript without any typechecking or autocompletion is hell.

Worse than this though is the repetetive nature of what needs solving. TODO ADD MORE

### Existential issues

### Workflow issues

## Where do we go from here
